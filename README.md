# Laravel package in development


This is just a storage repository to a laravel package in development, i dont have a name for it yet so i prefer to keep it into a storage repo.

The real repo will be up as soon as i have time to finish and test it.

Thanks.

## Edit
Turned out that laravel already have it implemented but there is no documentation explicit saying that it exists, i found out asking other people about it and just one answered me that. Anyways, it worked as a study case.
